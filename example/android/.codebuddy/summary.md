# Project Summary

## Overview of Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
The project primarily utilizes **Gradle** as the build automation tool, which is evident from the presence of multiple Gradle-related files. The project may also involve **Java** or **Kotlin** as the programming languages, given that Gradle is commonly used in Android development. The presence of `capacitor.settings.gradle` suggests that the project might be using **Capacitor**, a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

## Purpose of the Project
While the specific purpose of the project is not explicitly stated in the provided file structure, the inclusion of Capacitor indicates that the project is likely aimed at developing a mobile application that can run on both iOS and Android platforms.

## List of Build/Configuration/Project Files
- `/build.gradle`
- `/capacitor.settings.gradle`
- `/gradle.properties`
- `/gradlew`
- `/gradlew.bat`
- `/local.properties`
- `/settings.gradle`
- `/variables.gradle`

## Directories for Source Files
The provided file structure does not explicitly list any directories containing source files. Typically, in a Gradle project, source files would be located in a directory structure such as:
- `/src/main/java` (for Java source files)
- `/src/main/kotlin` (for Kotlin source files)
- `/src/main/resources` (for resource files)

## Location of Documentation Files
The provided file structure does not indicate the presence of any documentation files. Documentation is often found in files such as:
- `README.md`
- `docs/` directory

If documentation files exist, they would typically be located in one of these common locations, but none are specified in the current file structure.

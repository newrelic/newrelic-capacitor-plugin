# Changelog

## 1.3.6

## New in this release

In this release, we are introducing several new features and updates:

* Added Offline Harvesting Feature: This new feature enables the preservation of harvest data that would otherwise be lost when the application lacks an internet connection. The stored harvests will be sent once the internet connection is re-established and the next harvest upload is successful.
* Introduced setMaxOfflineStorageSize API: This new API allows the user to determine the maximum volume of data that can be stored locally. This aids in better management and control of local data storage.
* Updated native iOS Agent: We've upgraded the native iOS agent to version 7.4.9, which includes performance improvements and bug fixes.
* Updated native Android Agent: We've also upgraded the native Android agent to version 7.3.0 bringing benefits like improved stability and enhanced features.
* Resolved an issue in the fetch instrumentation where the absence of a body led to failure in recording network requests by the agent.

These enhancements help to improve overall user experience and application performance.

## 1.3.5

## New in this release

This release addresses the following issues in the fetch instrumentation:

- Bug fix: Resolved an issue where options were undefined, causing the HTTP request to break. With this fix, options are properly defined, ensuring smooth functioning of the fetch instrumentation.

- Bug fix: Fixed an issue where the fetch instrumentation was not working correctly on browsers, rendering the customer unable to use the browser for development purposes.

These bug fixes enhance the reliability and compatibility of the fetch instrumentation, ensuring a seamless experience for customers during their development activities.


## 1.3.4

## New in this release
We have made some updates to our system to improve its functionality. These changes include:

- Fixed a bug in the fetch instrumentation where customer options were inadvertently removed when no headers were specified. Now, options will be preserved even when headers are absent.
- Resolved a bug in the XMLHttpRequest instrumentation that was throwing errors when headers were added by the instrumentation. This issue has been fixed to prevent any unexpected errors in such cases.
- Addressed an issue that resulted in app crashes when an invalid URL was encountered in the capacitor plugin. To mitigate this, a valid URL checker has been implemented to ensure that mobilerequest events are created only with valid URLs.

## 1.3.3

## New in this release
We have made some updates to our system to improve its functionality. These changes include:

- fetch instrumentation for http request
- Adds configurable request header instrumentation to network events 
  The agent will now produce network event attributes for select header values if the headers are detected on the request. The header names to instrument are passed into the agent when started.
- Upgrading the native iOS agent to version 7.4.8.
- Upgrading the native Android agent to version 7.2.0.

These updates are intended to improve overall performance and functionality of our system. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to enhance your experience.

- Adding support for non-text XMLHttpRequest response types for HTTP Instrumentation.

- Upgrading the native iOS agent to version 7.4.7.
